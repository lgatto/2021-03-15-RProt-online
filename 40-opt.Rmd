## R for Mass Spectrometry {#sec:r4ms}

The aim of the [R for mass
spectrometry](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/)
RforMassSpectrometry initiative is to provide efficient, thoroughly
documented, tested and flexible R software for the analysis and
interpretation of high throughput mass spectrometry assays, including
proteomics and metabolomics experiments. The project formalises the
longtime collaborative development efforts of its core members under
the RforMassSpectrometry organisation to facilitate dissemination and
accessibility of their work.

Two packages of interest:

- [Spectra](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Spectra/) ([poster](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/Conferences/raw/master/EuroBioc2019/Spectra/poster/poster.pdf))
- [QFeatures](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/)


## Affinity purification MS (AP-MS) {#sec:apms}

This use case features a proximity tagging protein-protein interaction
dataset. In this experiment, a bait protein `X` was tagged using
[BioID2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26912792). BioID
biotinylates proteins in close proximity of the bait `X`, in
particular, but not only, proteins interacting with `X`. These
proteins are then be recovered using streptavidin beads and
identified/quantified using mass spectrometry. The expectation is
that the proteins contain interaction partners of `X`. However, given
that a substantial number of false positives will also be
biotinylated, it is necessary to complement this data with a negative
control, where `X` is blocked from interacting with its partners. A
differential analysis between the wild type and the negative control
will reveal likely interacting partners of `X`.

Identify the most likely interactors of protein `X`.

### Exercise {-}

- Load the [data in the `bioid.csv`
  file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lgatto/2020-02-17-RProt-Berlin/master/data/bioid.csv)
  into R.
- Explore the missing data pattern.
- Try to identify interactors using a statistical t-test, or any
  method you see fit. You can use the `pos` variable to guide you:
  `TRUE` referring to a set of expected true interactors, but there
  might be more. 
- What are the issues? What solutions would you suggest?

```{r bioiddata}
library("MSnbase")
e <- readMSnSet2("./data/bioid.csv", ecol = 1:6, fnames = "ids")
e$grp <- sub("[1-3]", "", sampleNames(e))
sel1 <- fData(e)$Reverse == ""
sel2 <- fData(e)$Potential.contaminant == ""
e <- e[sel1 & sel2, ]
fData(e) <- fData(e)[, c("pos", "ids")] 
```

```{r bioideda}
limma::plotDensities(log2(exprs(e) + 1))
exprs(e)[exprs(e) == 0] <- NA
(e$nNA <- colSums(is.na(e)))
fData(e)$nNA <- rowSums(is.na(e))
table(fData(e)$nNA)
table(is.na(e))
sum(is.na(e))/prod(dim(e))
naplot(e, col = c("black", "white"))
```

```{r biodata3}
e_norm <- e %>%
    log(base = 2) %>%
    normalise(method = "center.median")
limma::plotMDS(exprs(e_norm))
limma::plotDensities(exprs(e_norm))

### `proDA`: probabilistic dropout analysis

We will now try the `proDA` package for *inference of protein
differential abundance by probabilistic dropout analysis*
([Ahlman-Eltze and Anders
(2019)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/661496v1)) that
explicity models missing values as lowly expressed features.

```{r}
library("proDA")
```

Below, we first fit the model using the `grp` variable.

```{r proda1, cache = TRUE}
proDA_fit <- proDA(e_norm,
                   design = ~ grp,
                   data_is_log_transformed = TRUE)
proDA_fit
```

Here we extract the contract of interest, setting the alternative to
greater to perform a one-sided test (we are only interested in
proteins with greater expression in the wild type),

```{r proda2}
res <- test_diff(proDA_fit,
          contrast = "grpWT",
          alternative = "greater",
          pval_adjust_method = "BH")

res %>%
    arrange(adj_pval) %>%
    filter(adj_pval < 0.1)
```

Below, we integrate the results in the `MSnSet` and visualise them
using a volcano plot. We observe an enrichment in true positives.


```{r prodares1}
stopifnot(identical(res$name, featureNames(e_norm)))
fData(e_norm) <- cbind(fData(e_norm), res)

with(fData(e_norm),
     plot(diff, -log10(adj_pval),
          col = as.numeric(pos) + 1))
abline(h = -log10(0.05))
abline(h = -log10(0.1), lty = "dotted")
```

```{r prodares2}
ms2df(e_norm) %>%
    arrange(adj_pval) %>%
    filter(adj_pval < 0.1)

table(fData(e_norm)$pos,
      fData(e_norm)$nNA)
```
