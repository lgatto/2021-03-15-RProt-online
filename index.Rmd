# Preamble {-}

This course will introduce participants to the analysis and
exploration of mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics data using R
and Bioconductor. The course will cover all levels of MS data, from
raw data to identification and quantitation data, up to the
statistical interpretation of a typical shotgun MS experiment and will
focus on hands-on tutorials. At the end of this course, the
participants will be able to manipulate MS data in R and use existing
packages for their exploratory and statistical proteomics data
analysis.

## Targeted audience and assumed background  {-}

The course is targeted to either proteomics practitioners or data
analysts/bioinformaticians that would like to learn how to use R and
Bioconductor to analyse proteomics data. Familiarity with MS or
proteomics in general is desirable, but not essential as we will walk
through and describe a typical MS data as part of learning about the
tools. Participants need to have a working knowledge of R (R syntax,
commonly used functions, basic data structures such as data frames,
vectors, matrices, ... and their manipulation). Familiarity with other
Bioconductor omics data classes and the tidyverse syntax is useful,
but not required.

## Program  {-}

- In the first part of this course, we will focus on raw MS data,
  including how mass spectrometry works, how raw MS data looks like,
  MS data formats, and how to extract, manipulate and visualise raw
  data.

- The second part will focus in identification data, how to combine
  them with raw data, quantitation of MS data, and introduce data
  structure of quantitative proteomics data.

- The last part will focus on quantitative proteomics, including data
 structures, data processing, visualisation statistical analysis to
 identify differentially expression proteins between two groups.
