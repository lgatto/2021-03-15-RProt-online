# Raw MS data: `mzR` and `MSnbase`

```{r rwpkgs, echo = FALSE}
x <- RforProteomics:::msDataTab()
sel <- x[, 1] %in% c("Raw", "Peak lists")
knitr::kable(x[sel, ])
```

In this section, we will learn how to read raw data in one of the
commonly used open formats (`mzML`, `mzXML` and `netCDF`) into R using
`mzR` (low level access) and `MSnbase` (higher level abstraction).

## Low level access

The `mzR` package in a direct interface to the
[proteowizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/) code base. It
includes a substantial proportion of *pwiz*'s C/C++ code for fast and
efficient parsing of these large raw data files.

Let's start by using some raw data files from the `msdata`
package. After loading it, we use the `proteomics()` function to
return the full file names for two raw data files. We will start by
focusing on the second one.

```{r rwfiles}
library("msdata")
f <- proteomics(full.names = TRUE)
f
(f2 <- grep("20141210", f, value = TRUE))
```

The three main functions of `mzR` are

* `openMSfile` to create a file handle to a raw data file
* `header` to extract metadata about the spectra contained in the file
* `peaks` to extract one or multiple spectra of interest. 

Other functions such as `instrumentInfo`, or `runInfo` can be used to
gather general information about a run.


```{r rawms}
library("mzR")
ms <- openMSfile(f2)
ms
```

```{r hd}
hd <- header(ms)
dim(hd)
names(hd)
```

```{r peaks}
head(peaks(ms, 117))
str(peaks(ms, 1:5))
```

### Exercise {-}

Let's extract the index of the MS2 spectrum with the highest base peak
intensity and plot its spectrum. Is the data centroided or in profile
mode?

<details>

```{r ex_raw, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
hd2 <- hd[hd$msLevel == 2, ]
i <- which.max(hd2$basePeakIntensity)
hd2[i, ]
pi <- peaks(ms, hd2[i, 1])
plot(pi, type = "h")
mz <- hd2[i, "basePeakMZ"]
plot(pi, type = "h", xlim = c(mz - 0.5, mz + 0.5))
```

### Exercise {-}

Pick an MS1 spectrum and visually check whether it is centroided or in
profile mode.

```{r ex_raw2}
## Zooming into spectrum 300 (an MS1 spectrum).
j <- 300
pj <- peaks(ms, j)
plot(pj, type = "l")
mz <- hd[j, "basePeakMZ"]
plot(pj, type = "l", xlim = c(mz - 0.5, mz + 0.5))
```
</details>


### Exercise {-}

Using the first raw data file starting with `MS3TMT10`, answer the
following questions:

* What type of data is returned by the `openMSfile` function?
* How many spectra are there in that file?
* How many MS levels, and how many spectra per MS level?
* What is the index of the MS2 spectrum with the highest precursor
  intensity?
* Plot one spectrum of each level. Are they centroided or in profile
  mode?

## High level abstraction

While having full access to the raw data gives full control, at times
it requires a lot of effort to achieve mundane things and can be very
repetitive. There is a need for abstraction, i.e. that we shouldn't
need to know about all the details that are exposed by `mzR` to access
and manipulate raw data. In comes `MSnbase` and the `MSnExp` data
structure, that provides a much smoother approach to *handle* and
*annotate* raw data (we will see this in more details tomorrow).

![MSnExp schematics](./img/pset.jpg)

An `MSnExp` contains the data and annotation to describe an MS
experiment. The data is composed of all the MS spectra (the output of
`mzR::peaks` above) and the annotation is stored in a
`data.frame`-like structure called the *feature metadata* slot
(*fData* for short). This feature metadata contains by default (or can
contain, to be precise) the content the `mzR::header` seen above, 
but can be extended as need (adding
identification data, for example).

```{r}
library("MSnbase")
```

Using the `readMSdata` function, passing one or more raw data file
names as input, we create an `MSnExp` object.

```{r readrw1, cache = TRUE}
rw1 <- readMSData(f2, mode = "inMemory", verbose = FALSE)
rw1
```

```{r readrw2}
rw2 <- readMSData(f2, mode = "onDisk", verbose = FALSE)
rw2
```

### Exercise {-}

What differences can you spot between the `rw1` and `rw2` objects?
Hint: compare their length.

<details>
```{r}
length(rw1)
length(rw2)
table(msLevel(rw1))
table(msLevel(rw2))
```
</details>

From the outside, the two functions above are very similar. The major
difference is that the former reads the data from only one type of MS
level into memory. The second function, does not read any raw data
into memory (and hence is much faster) and supports any number of MS
levels. The raw data is accessed on demand when needed. If you are
interested in a benchmark between the two approaches, look at the
[*benchmarking*
vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/MSnbase/inst/doc/benchmarking.html),
available by typing `vignette("benchmarking", package = "MSnbase")`.

Let's extract spectra `r i` and `r j`, or 1 to 5, as we did above. We
can do this using the familiar `[[` and `[` operators:

```{r}
## i and j were defined above
rw1[[i]]
rw2[[i]]
rw1[[j]]
rw2[[j]]
```

```{r}
rw1[1:5]
rw2[1:5]
```

And plot them

```{r}
plot(rw1[[j]])
```

```{r}
plot(rw1[[i]], full = TRUE, reporters = TMT6, centroided = TRUE)
```

The feature metadata is stored as part of the `MSnExp` object and can
be accessed with the `fData` accessor function

```{r}
head(fData(rw2))
```

Below, we will continue to work with the *on disk* raw data object.

## More data handling

Is the data centroided or in profile mode?

```{r}
head(centroided(rw2))
table(centroided(rw2))
table(centroided(rw2), msLevel(rw2))
```

It is also possible to set this when readin the data or manually

```{r}
tmp <- readMSData(f2, mode = "onDisk", centroided = c(FALSE, TRUE), verbose = FALSE)
table(centroided(tmp), msLevel(tmp))
```

```{r}
tmp <- readMSData(f2, mode = "onDisk", verbose = FALSE)
centroided(tmp, msLevel = 1) <- FALSE
centroided(tmp, msLevel = 2) <- TRUE
table(centroided(tmp), msLevel(tmp))
```
### Peak lists

Similarly as for raw data, peak lists can be read into R as `MSnExp`
data using the `readMgfData`. See `?readMgfData` for details.

### Exercise {-}

Using the file starting with `MS3TMT10`:

* Create an `MSnExp` object
* What MS levels do you have, and how many spectra of each
* What is the mode of the different MS levels


## Visualisation of raw MS data

The importance of flexible access to specialised data becomes visible
in the figure below (taken from the `RforProteomics` [visualisation
vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/vignettes/RforProteomics/inst/doc/RProtVis.html)).
Not only can we access specific data and understand/visualise them,
but we can transverse all the data and extracted/visualise/understand
structured slices of data.


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/msvisfig.png")
```

In this code chunks we start by selecting relevant spectra of
interest. We will focus on the first MS1 spectrum acquired after 30
minutes of retention time.


```{r pxd1}
## (3) MS1 spectra indices
ms1 <- which(msLevel(rw2) == 1)
## (4) Select MS1 spectra with retention time between 30 and 35 minutes
rtsel <- rtime(rw2)[ms1] / 60 > 30 &
                  rtime(rw2)[ms1] / 60 < 35
## (5) Indices of the 1st and 2nd MS1 spectra after 30 minutes
i <- ms1[which(rtsel)][1]
j <- ms1[which(rtsel)][2]
## (6) Interleaved MS2 spectra
ms2 <- (i+1):(j-1)
```

Now let's extract and plot all relevant information:

* The upper panel represents the chromatogram of the `r basename(fileName(ms))`
  raw data file, produced with `chromatogram`. See `?chromatogram` for details.

```{r visfig01}
chr <- chromatogram(rw2)
chr
plot(chr)
```

* We concentrate at a specific retention time, 
  `r formatRt(hd[i, "retentionTime"])` minutes (`r hd[i, "retentionTime"]` seconds) 

```{r visfig02}
plot(chr)
abline(v = fData(rw2)[i, "retentionTime"], col = "red")
```

* This corresponds to the `r i` th MS1 spectrum, shown on the second row of figures.

```{r visfig03}
p <- plot(rw2[[i]]) 
p + ggplot2::xlim(400, 1000)
```
 
or using base plotting:
 
```{r visfog03b}
pi <- as(rw2[[i]], "data.frame")
plot(pi, type = "l", xlim = c(400, 1000))
legend("topright", bty = "n",
       legend = paste0(
           "Acquisition ", acquisitionNum(rw2)[i],  "\n",
           "Retention time ", formatRt(rtime(rw2)[i])))
``` 

* The ions that were selected for MS2 are highlighted by vertical
  lines. These are represented in the bottom part of the figure.

```{r visfig04}
plot(pi, type = "l", xlim = c(400, 1000))
legend("topright", bty = "n",
       legend = paste0(
           "Acquisition ", acquisitionNum(rw2)[i],  "\n",
           "Retention time ", formatRt(rtime(rw2)[i])))
abline(v = precursorMz(rw2)[ms2],
       col = c("#FF000080",
           rep("#12121280", 9)))
```

* On the right, we zoom on the isotopic envelope of one peptide in
  particular (the one highlighted with a red line).

```{r visfig05}
plot(pi, type = "l", xlim = c(521, 522.5))
abline(v = precursorMz(rw2)[ms2], col = "#FF000080")
```

* A final loop through the relevant MS2 spectra plots the
  `length(ms2)` MS2 spectra highlighted above.

```{r visfig06, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 10}
par(mfrow = c(5, 2), mar = c(2, 2, 0, 1))
for (ii in ms2) {
    pj <- as(rw2[[ii]], "data.frame")
    plot(pj, xlab = "", ylab = "", type = "h", cex.axis = .6)
    legend("topright", legend = paste0("Prec M/Z\n",
                           round(precursorMz(rw2)[ii], 2)),
           bty = "n", cex = .8)
}
```

## Relations between spectra

The `filterPrecursorScan` makes the above much easier by extracting
*related* spectra:


```{r rel1}
i <- which(rtime(rw2)/60 > 30 & msLevel(rw2) == 1)[1]
acquisitionNum(rw2)[i]
rw3 <- filterPrecursorScan(rw2, 2807)
rw3
```

## MS map

Below, we illustrate some additional visualisation and animations of
raw MS data, also taken from the `RforProteomics`
[visualisation vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/vignettes/RforProteomics/inst/doc/RProtVis.html). On
the left, we have a heatmap visualisation of a MS map and a 3
dimensional representation of the same data. On the right, 2 MS1
spectra in blue and the set of interleaves 10 MS2 spectra.

```{r msmap1, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
## Additional packages
library("lattice")
library("gridExtra")

M3 <- MSmap(rw2, ms1[rtsel], 521, 523, .005)
plot(M3, aspect = 1, allTicks = FALSE)
plot3D(M3)

if (require("rgl") & interactive())
    plot3D(M3, rgl = TRUE)
```

```{r msmap2, message=FALSE, fig.width=15, echo=TRUE}
i <- ms1[which(rtsel)][1]
j <- ms1[which(rtsel)][2]
M4 <- MSmap(rw2, i:j, 100, 1000, 1)
plot3D(M4)    
```

Below, we have animations build from extracting successive slices as above.

![MS animation 1](./img/msanim1.gif)
![MS animation 2](./img/msanim2.gif)



## Raw data processing

For raw data processing look at `MSnbase`'s `clean`, `smooth`,
`pickPeaks`, `removePeaks` and `trimMz` for `MSnExp` and spectra
processing methods.

As an illustration, we show the `pickPeaks` function on the
`itraqdata` data. Centoiding transforms the distribution of M/Z values
measured for an ion (i.e. a set of M/Z and intensities, first figure
below) into a single M/Z and intensity pair of values (second figure
below).


```{r peakpicking, fig.keep = "last", fig.cap = "Peak picking: profile mode."}
library("ggplot2") ## for coord_cartesian
data(itraqdata)
plot(itraqdata[[10]], full = TRUE) +
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(915, 925))
```

```{r peakpicking2, fig.keep = "last", fig.cap = "Peak picking: centroided."}
itraqdata2 <- pickPeaks(itraqdata)
plot(itraqdata2[[10]], full = TRUE) +
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(915, 925))
```

vignette](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/articles/v01-MSnbase-demo.html)
and the [*centroiding of profile-mode MS
data*](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/articles/v03-MSnbase-centroiding.html).


The `r Biocpkg("MALDIquant")` and `r Biocpkg("xcms")` packages also
features a wide range of raw data processing methods on their own ad
hoc data instance types.
