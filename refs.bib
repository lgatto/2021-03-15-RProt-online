                  workflows for differential expression (DE) analysis
                  of proteins impose important challenges on the data
                  analysis due to peptide-specific effects and context
                  dependent missingness of peptide
                  intensities. Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob,
                  test for DE directly from peptide intensities and
                  outper-form summarization methods which first
                  aggregate MS1 peptide intensities to protein
                  intensities before DE analysis. However, these
                  methods are computationally expensive, often hard to
                  understand for the non-specialised end-user, and do
                  not provide protein summaries, which are important
                  for visualisation or downstream processing. In this
                  work, we therefore evaluate state-of-the-art
                  summarization strategies using a benchmark spike-in
                  dataset and discuss why and when these fail compared
                  to the state-of-the-art peptide based model,
                  MSqRob. Based on this evaluation, we propose a novel
                  summarization strategy, MSqRob-Sum, which estimates
                  MSqRob{\textquoteright}s model parameters in a
                  two-stage procedure circumventing the drawbacks of
                  peptide-based workflows. MSqRobSum maintains
                  MSqRob{\textquoteright}s superior performance, while
                  providing useful protein expression summaries for
                  plotting and downstream analysis. Summarising
                  peptide to protein intensities considerably reduces
                  the computational complexity, the memory footprint
                  and the model complexity, and makes it easier to
                  disseminate DE inferred on protein
                  summaries. Moreover, MSqRobSum provides a highly
                  modular analysis framework, which provides
                  researchers with full flexibility to develop data
                  analysis workflows tailored towards their specific
                  applications.},
